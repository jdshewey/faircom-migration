# Faircom Migration Tools
This repo contains tools to migrate from various DBs to the [Faircom DB](https://www.faircom.com/products/faircom-db)

The Faircom uses the [c-treeDB API API][https://docs.faircom.com/doc/ctreedb/]

A quickstart guide for setting up is available in the [Faircom docs](https://docs.faircom.com/doc/FairCom-Installation/)
